# label_colors_macro.py

A lightweight internal macro for 3D Slicer that automatically assigns predefined colors to anatomical segments based on their names.  
Developed to streamline repetitive labeling tasks in segmentation workflows.

This script adds a **“Apply Color” button** to the Segment Editor. When clicked, it applies consistent, pre-defined colors to structures such as arteries, veins, and ureters.

---

## Purpose

While working with dozens of segmentations, I needed a quick way to:

- Assign consistent colors across datasets
- Avoid manual selection from the color picker
- Reduce labeling time and prevent mistakes

This macro was developed and used in real-world labeling workflows for clinical AI datasets.  
It is **not intended for public distribution**, but serves as a personal automation utility.

## Built-in Color Logic

No external configuration needed — segment names and colors are defined inside the script:

| Group | Color     | Segment Names |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Arteries | `#af0000` | `Ao`, `SMA`, `RA`, `EIA_left`, ... |
| Veins    | `#0000ff` | `IVC`, `SMV`, `CIV_right`, ... |
| Ureter   | `#ffff00` | `ureter` |

- If a segment name does not match the predefined list, it will be skipped silently.

## How to Use

1. Copy `slicerrc_template.py` to your user home directory and rename it to `.slicerrc.py`.

   Example (Windows):
   ```
   C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.slicerrc.py
   ```

2. Restart 3D Slicer.

3. Open the **Segment Editor** → the **Apply Color** button should appear at the bottom.

4. Click the button to apply the predefined colors to any matching segment names.
